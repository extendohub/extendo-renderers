# extendo-renderers
Random collection of rendering code that you can reference and install on your enterprises/orgs/repos/... 

* xlsx - A simple Excel spreadsheet renderer 
* js - Pretty print and render large (typically minimized) JavaScript files
* stl - Use three.js to render STL files and give an interactive experience 
* markvis - Visualize markvis marked up charts

Note that this repo just contains the renderers, it does not install any rendering configuration -- that's for you to do. This is just shareable logic in the same way that an Action is a shared bit of code that can be used by many different workflows.
